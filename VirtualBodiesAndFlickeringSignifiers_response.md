# Katherine Hayles "Virtual Bodies and Flickering Signifiers"
## Response

> In this last decade of the twentieth century, information circulates as the
 currency of the realm. Genetics, warfare, entertainment, communications, grain
 production, and financial markets number among the sectors of society revolution-
 ized by the shift to an information paradgm.
 
 This make me think about "The Bias of Communication" by Harold Innis. He divided media into time-biased and space-biased types. The first type is related to heavy materials,
 while the latter to light materials. The concepts of time and space reflect the significance of media to civilization.
 
 I noticed that in the explanation of the shift from absence/presence to randomness/pattern there are many references to Jeremy Rifkin's "Age of Access".
 
 > The crucial difference between the Jamesian point of view and cyberspace pov is that the former implies physical presence, whereas the latter does not.
 
 I found the argument about pov very interesting. I agree to Katherine Hayles statement: in digital space pov coincides with the character that is inside the digital space.
 But of course only the character is inside the cyberspace, and so there is no physical presence.
 Oterwise, in traditional media as books and cinema, pov usually implies physical presence because it usually belongs to a character of the story, who is present in the scene.
 
 > ... When an omniscient viewpoint is used, the limitations of the narrator's
 corporeality begin to fall away, but the suggestion of embodiment lingers in the
 idea of focus, the "scene" created by the eye's movement.
 
 But I do not agree when she says that an omniscent pov still implies physical presence. I do not understand this statement: the scene we see is created by the eye's movement, but
 it seems to me that it is the same thing that could happen in cyberspace. I found this part a but confusing.
 
 In general, I found this text very interesting but also difficult.
 Sometimes I found Katherine Hayles aguments more as an exihibition of her intelligence that actually useful to the comprehension of the text.
 > One way to understand this "always already" is through the probability
 function that mathematically defines information in Claude Shannon's classic
 equations in information theory. Were randomness not always already immanent,
 we would be in the Newtonian world of strict causality rather than the information-
 theoretic realm of probability.
 
 For example, here she talks about Newton's classic mechanics in contrast to Shannon's information theory. But I found this paragraph very confusing and useless, because even
 if there would be no casuality, I don't think that classic mechanics laws could be applied to information theory. They don't fit.
