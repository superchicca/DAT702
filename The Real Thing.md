**Synopsis**

The VR documentary “The Real Thing” offers us an immersion inside life-size copies of vast
districts of famous European cities in China. The user can explore Paris Tiandu Cheng, Venice Water Town and London Tower Bridge in Suzhou, all located in the Shanghai region.
The user meets some locals, who tell him about their life, their home, their work. He finds himself
facing a weird situation: normal Chinese daily life takes place inside architectural replicas of famous European monuments, which were built in a cultural context
completely different from their original one.
Local citizens reflect on their life in copies of famous cities and what it would be like to visit the
"Original" cities in Europe, where they hope to go one day:
- Paris Tiandu Cheng:
>Imagine that Paris is a romantic city.

>In Paris in France they probably don't know about our existence, they have no idea about this
twin city.
- Venice City of Water:
>Imagine Venice as a city not only surrounded by water, but totally criss-crossed by watercourses.

>This Venice is only an image of Venice. We copied its architecture but not his lifestyle.

>Why do people like the village of Venice? Why do they buy their homes here? Because they
like exotic things. Beautiful things but rare at the same time.
- London Tower Bridge, Suzhou:
>Many people call this bridge the Mirror Bridge. It is very similar to Tower Bridge in London.
Its name in Chinese may mean that it is a reflection of the original bridge.

>(Talking about the many photo sets used for wedding photo shoots) It's a great one
experience for people to take pictures here: they seem to be in London but they never have
left China. (And again) The internal sets are called Utopia.

>If I go to London one day and visit Tower Bridge, everything will seem very familiar to me: it would feel like I am at home in my hometown.

From The Real Thing official site:
>The Real Thing is a journey into a copy of our world. Seeking the monumental copycat architecture
of China and other countries around the world.
Residential areas where people live an everyday life in places simulating other places.

**Technical and Stylistic Analysis**

The narrative appears to be divided into three main chapters, one for each city shown. Then, there is a conclusion, in which we see a faster editing of scenes from the three cities, and at the beginning an introduction recreated in computer graphics.

The introduction presents a forward tracking shot in a corridor: during the video,
we will recognize some of the environments that are presented here as stylized drawings, using dyes
light pastels on the dark background. We can consider it as a sort of rabbit hole, a real
entrance into the world of storytelling. This concept is reinforced by the camera movement: the
forward traking shot, a typical camera movement of post-modern cinema, indicates the idea of immersion within the
history and entrance into his world.

The viewer's point of view within the narrative is the one of a passive spectator. Sometimes the user find himself next to the characters: we closely observe the development of their daily life and,
meanwhile, a voice-over of the characters tell us about their experiences. In other scenes, however, we are suspended
over the cities: we glide over the landscapes in order to better observe the vastness and accuracy of the copies.

The tripod has been removed (tripod removal) in order not to interrupt the immersion of the images. Furthermore, the
sound recorded by the camera has been spatialized (audio ambisonics) to faithfully reproduce the one
of the environment around the user. The audio is completed with the narration carry out by the characters and inserted
through a stereo head locked voice-over and a soundtrack, also stereo head locked.

There are a lot of camera movements, but they are carried out in a cautious and accurate way in order to avoid motion sickness. Often, in fact, the camera performs slow tracking shots forward, and sometimes even backward or
sideways or upwards, guiding the user in the exploration of the environment. However, although the environmental component is very strong and it is one of the main themes of the story, I found that the product itself does not invite the user to explore independently by shifting your point of view: I think that the main cause is that the English subtitles are always located only in the northern point of the camera (only sometimes we found them
also rotated 180° to the south). The English subtitles are necessary for those unfamiliar with Chinese to understand the
storytelling.

The main exploration of the environment therefore is indicated by the director through the camera movements. And it is also a very strong component of the narrative: the user is curious to observe
the reproductions of universally known cities, to see them located in totally different contexts (the total absence of tourists is the first sign that indicate that the user is not under the "original" Eiffel Tower
or in the "real" Piazza San Marco). The user can also notice that the reproductions are very accurate in details and in real scale. He is interested in knowing these "simulated cities": it is probably true, as the
lady of noodles in Chinese Paris, that in Europe nobody is aware of their existence
(personally, as a European, I had no idea of the existence of these cities), and therefore he wants to know more
about the life that takes place in these places so familiar and unknown at the same time. This
further discovery occurs through the characters and their stories.

The user listen to short stories about the characters' daily life: he discovers what work they do and what difficulties they have
had to overcome to achieve their goals. So, the user empathise with them: he can relate to their daily life stories, despite the distance that separates their cultures and countries. Furthermore, the physical distance with the characters is often virtually canceled: the user is
often positioned very close to them and he can observe them working and doing their chores. He is a passive and omniscient spectator: the user does not interfere with the actions of the characters and listens to their stories through a
voice-overs, not through a real-time storytelling. This privileged position of the user makes the actions presented believable: since he does not actively participate, it makes the everyday life of the characters authentic.

I am going to analyze a couple of scenes that I was particulary struck by.

The first scene is one in Suzhou by the London Tower Bridge. The user is in the middle of a photo shoot for a wedding. He is literally
placed between the photographer and the future spouses. The north of the scene is on the photographer's side: at the beginning, therefore, it seems to be
the user himself the photographed subject. Turning around, however, he discovers the two future spouses posing in front of the Tower
Bridge, with an assistant next to them holding a matte box. We hear the photographer talking to the couple: he can deduce from the context and from the photographer gestures that he is giving indications to the spouses on how to
strike a pose for the shots. However, his words are not translated: they are part of the ambient audio
recorded on site and they are spatialized in the background. Instead, what the user hears and is translated
with subtitles is the voice-over of the photographer himself (the main character of this chapter) which tells about his work. The subtitles are placed to allow the user to turn around and discover his position in the scene: they are in front of the photographer and rotated 180° in front of the bride and groom.

The user is in a privileged position: through other media or even live he could not
being in the middle of the photo shoot and could not observe both the photographer and the couple
frontally. Instead, through VR video it becomes an intangible and omniscient entity.

The second scene takes place in Paris Tiandu Cheng. The user is a spectator in front of what looks like a festival: there is music and a group of people in front of him, with coordinated clothes, is dancing. In the background stands the Eiffel Tower, illuminated by
multiple bright colors lights.

The experience for a Western user is almost alienating: he recognizes the environment (the Eiffel Tower is
unmistakable) but not the action that takes place before his eyes. He notices immediatly that he can't be in the
Paris that he knows: the bright colors of the LEDs that illuminate the tower, Chinese pop music and the particular dance
group are unprecedented, especially in the context of what appears to be the French capital.

**Conclusions and Connections**
>Whatever the style of architecture, what matters is the human element

Even if the environment is simulated, the lives of the people who live there are not. Their lives
they are quite distinct from the fact that they live in copies of European cities: their lifestyle is in fact the chinese one.

Linking to Janet Murray's "Virtual / Reality: How to tell the difference" article, it is therefore evident that is not possibile for citizens to confuse their copy cities with authentic ones.
These copy cities are, in my humble opinion, a victorious example of the postmodern aesthetics:
the revival of pre-existing forms is evident here, but placed in a different context they generate a completely new world.
