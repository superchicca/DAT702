**Synopsis**

The VR documentary “The Real Thing” offers us an immersion inside life-size copies of vast
districts of famous European cities in China. The user can in fact consult Paris Tiandu Cheng, Venice Water Town and London Tower Bridge in Suzhou, all located in the Shanghai region.
The user meets some locals, who tell him about their life, their home, their work. Is situated
facing a strange situation: normal Chinese daily life takes place inside replicas
architectural features of famous European monuments, which were built in a cultural context
completely different from theirs.
Local citizens reflect on their life in copies of famous cities and what it is like to visit cities
"Original", in Europe, where they hope to go one day:
- Paris Tiandu Cheng:
>Imagine that Paris is a romantic city.
>In Paris in France they probably don't know about our existence, they have no idea about this
twin city.
- Venice City of Water:
>Image Venice as a city not only surrounded by water, but totally criss-crossed by watercourses.

>This Venice is only a facade (image) of Venice. We copied its architecture but not his lifestyle.

>Why do people like the village of Venice? Why do they buy their homes here? Why the
like exotic things. Beautiful things but rare at the same time.
- London Tower Bridge, Suzhou:
>Many people call this bridge the Mirror Bridge. It is very similar to Tower Bridge in London.
Its name in Chinese may mean that it is a reflection of the original bridge.

>(Talking about the many photo sets used for wedding photo shoots) It's a great one
experience for people to take pictures here: they seem to be in London but they never have
left China. (And again) The internal sets are called Utopia.

>If I go to London one day and visit Tower Bridge, everything will seem very familiar to me: me
it will feel like home, in my hometown.

From The Real Thing official site:
>The Real Thing is a journey into a copy of our world. Seeking the monumental copycat architecture
of China and other countries around the world.
Residential areas where people live an everyday life in places simulating other places.

**Technical and Stylistic Analysis**

The narrative appears to be divided into three main chapters, one for each city shown. It then makes use of
a conclusion, in which we see a faster editing of scenes from the three cities, and of
an introduction recreated in computer graphics.

The introduction presents a forward tracking shot in a corridor: during the continuation of the video,
we will recognize some of the environments that are presented here as stylized drawings, using dyes
light pastels on the dark background. We can consider it as a sort of rabbit hole, a real one
entry into the world of storytelling. This conception is reinforced by the movement of the machine: the trolley
forward, a typical camera movement of post-modern cinema, indicates the idea of ​​immersion within the
history and entry into his world.

The viewer's point of view within the narrative is that of a passive spectator. Sometimes there
we find next to the characters: we closely observe the development of their daily life and, in
meanwhile, their narrative voices tell us about their experiences. In other scenes, however, we find ourselves suspended
over the cities: we glide over the landscapes in order to better observe the vastness and accuracy of the copies.
The tripod has been removed (tripod removal) in order not to interrupt the immersion of the images. Furthermore, the
sound recorded by the camera has been spatialized (audio ambisonics) to faithfully reproduce that
of the environment around the user. The audio is completed with the narration completed by the characters and inserted
through a stereo head locked voice over and a soundtrack, also stereo head locked.

The camera movements are many, but they are carried out in a cautious and accurate way in order to avoid problems
of motion sickness. Often, in fact, the camera performs slow tracking shots forward, and sometimes even backward or
sideways or upwards, guiding us in the exploration of the environment. However, although the component
environmental is very strong, being one of the main themes of the story, I found that the product itself does not
you invite more than so much to autonomous exploration by shifting your point of view: the main cause I think
that they are subtitles in English, almost always located only in the northern point of the room (only sometimes they come
repeated rotated 180 °, to the south), which are necessary for those unfamiliar with Chinese to understand the
storytelling.

The preferred exploration of the environment therefore wants to be that indicated by the director through the movements
of room. And it is also a very strong component of the narrative: the user is curious to observe
the reproductions of universally known cities, to see them located in totally different contexts (the absence
total number of tourist crowds is the first aspect that makes us understand that we are not under the "original" Eiffel Tower
or in the "real" Piazza San Marco), and to note how carefully these reproductions have been made on one
scale so big. We are interested in knowing these "simulated cities": it is probably true, as the
lady of noodles in Chinese Paris, which in Europe is not aware of their existence
(personally, as a European, I had no idea of the existence of these cities), and therefore we want to know more
about the life that takes place in these places so familiar and unknown at the same time. This
further discovery occurs through the characters and their stories.

We listen to short stories of the characters' daily life: we discover what work they do and what difficulties they have
had to overcome to achieve their goals and in this way we feel empathy towards them: there
we recognize in their words and in their daily life, despite the distance that separates our cultures and i
countries we live in. Furthermore, the physical distance with the characters is often virtually canceled: the user comes
often positioned very close to them and can observe them working and doing their chores. He is a spectator
passive and omniscient: does not interfere with the actions of the characters and listens to their stories through a
voice overs that runs over the images, and not live. This privileged position gives credibility
to the actions presented: the fact of not intervening makes the everyday life of the characters authentic.

I am going to analyze a couple of scene that I was particulary struck by.

The first scene is one in Suzhou by the London Tower Bridge. The user is in the middle of a photo shoot for a wedding. Literally in between: it is indeed
placed between the photographer and the future spouses. The north of the scene is on the photographer's side: at the beginning, therefore, it seems to be
the user himself the photographed subject. Turning around, however, we discover the two future spouses posing in front of the Tower
Bridge, with an assistant next to him holding a matte box. We hear the photographer talking to the couple: a
judging from the context and from his gestures we deduce that he is giving indications to the spouses on how
strike a pose for the shots. However, his words are not translated: they are part of the ambient audio
recorded on site from the room and are spatialized and in the background. Instead, what we hear and is translated
with subtitles is the voice over of the photographer himself (the main character of this chapter of the
narration) which tells about his work. The subtitles are placed in such a way as to allow the user to turn around and
to discover his position in the scene: they are in front of the photographer and rotated 180 ° in front of the bride and groom.

The user is in a privileged position: through other media or even live he could not
being in the middle of the photo shoot and could not observe both the photographer and the couple
frontally. Instead, through VR video it becomes an intangible and omniscient entity.

The second scene takes place in Paris Tiandu Cheng. The user is a spectator in front of what looks like a festival: a group in front of him
of people, with coordinated clothes, dance to the rhythm of the music. In the background stands the Eiffel Tower, illuminated by
multiple bright colors.

The experience for a Western user is almost alienating: he recognizes the environment (the Eiffel Tower is
unmistakable) but not the action that takes place before his eyes. Notice right away that it can't be in the
Paris that knows: the bright colors of the LEDs that illuminate the tower, Chinese pop music and the particular dance
group are unprecedented, especially in the context of what appears to be the French capital.

**Conclusions and Connections**
>Whatever the style of architecture, what matters is the human element

Even if the environment is simulated, the lives and everyday life of the people who live there are not. Their lives
they are quite distinct from the fact that they live in copies of European cities: the lifestyle they follow is in fact that
east of China.

By linking to Janet Murray's "Virtual / Reality: How to tell the difference" article, it is therefore evident that not
there is the possibility for citizens to confuse their copy cities with authentic ones.
These copy cities are, in my humble and humble opinion, a victorious example of the aesthetics of the postmodern:
the revival of pre-existing forms is evident here, but placed in a different context they generate a world
totally new.
