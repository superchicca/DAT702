# Janet Murray "Virtual / Reality: How to Tell the Difference
## Analysis and Response

From the abstract:
>With the advent of mass consumer headsets and controllers for experiencing virtual reality 
applications in the second decade of the twentieth century, some expert commentators have 
responded by predicting that we are on a path toward losing the distinction between the real and 
the virtual.

>This article argues against thinking of VR as a magical technology 
for creating seamless illusions. Instead it situates VR as an emerging medium within an evolving 
community that is beginning to develop the media conventions to support sustained interaction 
and immersion.

Janet Murray is a professor in the School of Literature, Media, and Communication at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I think that this article can offer a pragmatic and 
well-thought analysis of VR based on experience.

Janet Murray criticizes the exaggerated hype of some assertions on VR, including Chris Milk TEDTalk in which he defines it "empathy machine".
But mostly she criticizes this kind of assertions when they come from the academic world. For example, when the Stanford Human Interaction Lab says that "VR systems block out
the perceptual input from the real world and replace it with perceptual input from a virtual environment that surrounds the user, is fully responsive to the user's actions,
and elicits feelings of presence."
Her critique is very simple and practical.
>The IVE may be produced by covering one’s eyes and attaching sensors, but it does not 
eliminate the physical sensation of wearing a headset and handling controllers.

Based on my personal experience with VR, I agree with her.

>As a justification for the perfectly reasonable pursuit of more research around using VR to 
expand empathy, such optimistic statements about an emerging medium are unsurprising. But 
they have had the secondary effect of encouraging belief in the inevitability of a future migration 
away from our biological bodies and into a computer-generated world. And this attitude of 
omnipotent representational powers leading to a replacement of the real world with the virtual 
world has led non-scientists to overestimate the present and future of VR experiences.

In my opinion, it is correct to be optimistic and enthusiastic for the future of VR: it surely is a powerful medium that can create strong immersive experiences if used correctly.
But we have also to be realist and to look at the actual technologies and at the experiences that they can produce.

Janet Murray analyzes some reseraches by Micheal Madary and Thomas K. Metzinger, two german philosophers. In 2016, they published "Real Virtuality: A Code of 
Ethical Conduct” offering “Recommendations for Good Scientific Practice and the Consumers of VR-Technology”.
>The authors immediately make it clear that they are most alarmed by their judgement that today’s entertainment gear are harbingers of a profound and inevitable change
>in human experience. (...) 
>This is a jarring claim, and one that would not be taken seriously if we were to substitute other 
immersive entertainment experiences, such as amusement park haunted houses or large format 
3D films, for VR headsets. But Madary and Metzinger present VR as if it were an entirely new 
phenomenon, divorced from other cultural rituals and genres, and they rest their claim on
empirical evidence, drawn from the Stanford group and from other highly respected researchers.

For me, Janet Murray is right in considering VR at the same level as other traditional media. I think that this is the main point of this article.

The critics goes on analyzing some experiments carried out by the german philosophers. They are sure that VR can create amazingly true experiences that would confuse the user
about what is real and what is not. 
>In fact, the elaborate apparatus needed for all of these of these examples to work, and the 
exquisite calibration they all require between the physical world and the virtual world mitigate 
against the notion of seamless immersion in a metaverse. The nightmare scenarios imaged from 
such laboriously constructed scenarios also ignore the fact that they require highly cooperative 
subjects, who could end the experience at any time by merely closing their eyes, but make the 
experiment succeed by choosing to remain engaged in the highly artificial environment of a lab 
simulation.

Janet Murray points out the two bigger requirments to create an immersive experience in VR:
- A massive technologic apparatus that must be calibrated precisely.
- A big effort for the users, that have to collaborate in order to achive the suspension of disbelief and feel a sense of presence in the digital environment.

Right now, VR technology is good and well developed, but there are stil a lot of limits to overcome (360 cameras definition, real-time reactions, massive quantity of data to manage
in 3D simulations, ...).
And in my opinion the effort required to the user is bigger in VR than in traditional media: in VR the user is not a passive spectator, but he often has an active role that has to 
pursue in order to complete the experiece in the way ti was created by the artist. He has to act, but not freely. In addition, his actions must been well-thought and dosed in
order to not destroy the flux of the story and the sense of presence. Probably, even if more powerful, the sense of immersion created by VR is more fragile.
>The illusion was successful, but also easily dispelled, because I 
never completely lost awareness of where I was, of what was real and what was virtual.

>One of the things that helps 
us to attain and sustain immersion in an illusion is our sense of a boundary between the real and 
the liminal world, the “fourth wall” of the theater, the TV or movie screen, the entrance to the 
haunted house. In interactive environments we often need a “threshold object” (Murray, 2018: 134) to take us over the boundary, something that has physical existence in this world but agency 
in the imagined world. The VR headset and hand controllers function in this way (Jean Ho Chu, 
2015). Putting on the apparatus signals us that we are entering an invented, human-authored 
reality.(...)But we retain awareness 
that our immersive cocoon exists as a subset of a much larger and more complex reality of lived 
experience. It is in fact this double consciousness that makes VR so thrilling – our sense that the 
virtual seems so real despite our knowledge that our feet are still planted in this world.

I find this paragraph very interesting. I agree with the fact that a treshold can help us to immerse in a fictional world. This also implies that we firmly know the difference
between our real world and a fictional world, as realistic it can be. In my opinion, it is better for VR artists to focus on how the VR headset treshold can help the audience
to achive immersion. That is because, right now, VR technology is quite hulking and cannot be remouved. So, I think that the audience would always be aware to be inside a 
fictional world, but at the same time the sense of presence that it would reach would be really strong. And as I see it, that is what is more important.

>Like other once-new media of representation, VR offers us an opportunity to find more 
expressive means of discovering and sharing who we are, what we know, what we love, what we 
suffer, what we wish for, and how we can together make a better world. It is not magical, and it 
cannot be a substitute for reality any more than books or films or role playing games can be. But 
it could be another modality with new affordances that can be built over time by the collective 
process of inventing a medium. VR, like any medium, can be used for benevolent or malevolent 
purposes. If we want to encourage VR practices that serve humane and ethical purposes it is 
important that our analytical discourse be anchored in the very real perils and challenges of the 
human lifeworld, and free from the false and distracting expectations – whether fearful or 
hopeful – of a magical escape from our shared physical reality into an impossible virtual future.

I really appreciate Janet Murray opinion of VR as a medium. I think that it also artist Céline Tricart thinks the same when she says that "VR is an empathy machine, as a book or
a film can be".
In my opinion, VR can be a powerful medium and can really be an "empathy machine". But it still have to refine its language and technologies.
I think that, as Janet Murray highlights in her conclusion, it is important to talk about VR in a realistic and pragmatic way: everybody saw how exaggerated hype buried VR in the 90s.
