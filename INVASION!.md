From INVASION! official site:

**Technical and Stylistic Analysis**

INVASION! is an animated VR short movie.
It is narrated by Ethan Hawke: he is an off-screen narrator that introduces the main characters, which include some cute bunnies and two very unexpected aliens with unknown
intentions. 

The virtual camera POV is first person: from the very beginning of the experience, the user understand that he impersonates a character in the story. 
>WHO AM I?  We dared to be the first widely distributed VR narrative to put the audience in the body of a character.  When you look down, like our protagonist, Chloe, you, too, are an innocent white rabbit on a frozen lake who will experience the most unexpected close encounter of the third kind, with winks to H.G. Wells along the way.  The execution was so real the NY Times said “the sense that you have fur lingers”—even after the experience. 

The user feel as a charachter also because Chloe, the white rabbit, iteracts with him: she look at him, come close and sniff him, and hide behind him when the aliens arrive. 
The user, from his perspective, interacts with Chloe and with the anliens changing his point of view by moving his head (assuming he is using a VR headset).
Even if this interaction is very small and simple, it is very powerful: the user can really feel as he is not only part of the story, but one of his main character.

>Inspired by science, we designed Chloe to be visually appealing with an engaging personality, allowing audiences not just to understand her actions, but connect to her feelings. Audiences have tried to coo at Chloe—to pet, play with, mimic and mirror her.  Movies occasionally break the “fourth wall” as in Birdman, but has the wall ever been broken behind you, as it does when viewers invariably turn around to protect Chloe?

The user feel immersed in the story also because of the design of the characters, especially Chloe. He can epathise with her at such a level that he is worried for her when the aliens land on Earth. 

**Conclusions**

As I see it, this short movie is an amazing representation of the VR definition as an "Empathy Machine". The plot is very simple and the interaction is at is minimum, but they 
are both created in an accurate way to maximise immersion and sense of presence through the pontentiality of this medium.
