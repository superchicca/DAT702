Céline Tricart is a VR director.
Her studies has been very traditional: she studied performing arts and cinema (since she is passionate in storytellyng) and then she trained in new technologies - 3D relief and
VR. In 2016, she set up her company Lucid Dream Production in Los Angeles.
In 2019, Celine premiered “The Key”, an interactive experience mixing immersive theater and VR
which won the Storyscapes Award at Tribeca. Shortly after, it won the prestigious Grand Jury Prize for Best VR Immersive Work at the Venice Film Festival. In 2020
she was in the jury for the VR expanded section  at the Venice Film Festival.

In the interview by Institut Francais, Céline Tricart talks about some of her works and experiences with VR.

Céline Tricart worked together with Maria Bello on "The Sun Ladies" (2017), a documentary about Yezidi women fighting ISIS in Iraq. She choosed to use VR for this documentary.
>Virtual reality has allowed us to give the impression of intimacy: these women are in front of us and look us straight in the eyes. They tell us their story in the same way
they would blow a secret in our ear. The screen is often a wall of emotional separation. VR overcomes this obstacle and rekindles our emotions.

I think that the sense of presence created with VR in this documentary can hardly been replaced with other media. With VR, the spectator is allowed to be (virtually) near the women
and to listen their stories as he was there with them. In this way, a deep connection between the spectator and the women is created: they became virtually friends, they share an
experience, a secret.
That is why, in my opinion, when Céline Tricart invited audiences at festivals where the film was shown to write to the Sun Ladies, a lot of people contributed with therir messages.
The connection between the Sun Ladies and the audience was not only virtual, but also physical.

>During filming I sometimes felt a bit parasitic, with the feeling of stealing from these women their stories, as I was a filmmaker and not a journalist.
As storytellers, we have a responsibility towards people we are talking about. Usually, this is more true for journalist and documentarist.

That is why Céline Tricart felt as she had
no right to tell the Sun Ladies stories.
With The Key, created thanks to the Oculus VR for Good programme, Céline Tricart offered a different perspective on the issue of refugees: she offered, again, a sense of responsibility
of the audiens towards refugees.
In this project she combined immersive theater, animation and VR. 
>The Keyis often presented as an escape game, an artistic exploration, but it is only at the end that we discover that, in essence, it is the daily lives of millions of people.
Using immersive theatre creates a kind of transition to VR, which takes place in stages with The Key. People don't know that when they go into the installation, they are already
in the story’s world. The emotional impact is even greater at the end of the experience. There is no message, other than the idea that could be summarised as follows:
"Now you know. Here is an overview of the feelings you feel when you are a refugee."

She achieved this introducing small and specific **moments of choice**. Using the word "choice" insted of "interaction" we can focus on a peculiar aspect: this is not an automatic
interaction, but the user choose to interact. The user is aware of is choice, and so he is responsible for it.

Céline Tricart recalled Chris Milk definition of VR as an **empathy machine**.
>VR is an empathy machine, just as a book or film can be. It is true that by controlling the field of vision VR offers privileged access to the mental mechanisms of emotion
and empathy, even if it is not so easy to provoke, as with other mediums. Nevertheless, VR has extraordinary potential: it allows the human mind to transcend reality and create
differently.

I believe that she is right and that VR but also book and film can be considered empathy machines, because they try to gain leverage on the audience feelings. Every media is different,
and so the way to achive this goal is different too. As I see it, VR is advantaged because it can literally put the user inside the scene and inside the fictional world. In this way,
create a sense of presence and a suspension of disbelief is easier, because the user became part of the story.
