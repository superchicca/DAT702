## Analysis and Response

With this article on Immerse (2016), Janet Murray provides a sort of guide for people who approach the production of VR contents for the first time.
She assertes that what have been produced till that moment is generally bad, but she is not worried at all: quite the opposite, she thinks that these are necessary failures that 
will lead to find out what kind of contents and narrative solutions are better for VR.

These are the aim of the articles explained by Janet Murray herself:
> As someone who as been practicing and teaching narrative design in new digital media genres long enough to have seen the phenomenon of over-excitement at a novel techology 
> combined with design confusion many times before, I want to counter two of the most common confusions about VR.
> I also want to offer some illustrative example of how to spot good design in the hope of speeding up the process of finding the lasting expressive strategies on which to build
> new story forms.

Then, she started talking about the two most common confusion.

> Confusion One: VR is not a film to be watched but a virtual space to be visited and navigated through.

This statement makes me think to the one CÃ©line Tricart made when she was asked if VR was the future of cinema: "VR is not the future of anything, it has his own future". 
I agree with this: I think that, even if it can be helpful use learnings from media we know better, it is correct and important to remember that VR is a different medium and it 
need to develop its own rules and grammar.

Janet Murray makes then a list of tips about this topics. More than tips they sound like proper rules one must follow in order to succeed, though.
I think that most of them are sincerely good rules: thinking about the user body in space, using sound design wisely with spatial and real audio are the ones I related the most.
Anyway, for me Janet Murray is a bit drastic when she says that we should not use any extra-diegetic features, such as voice-overs, text overlays and background music. In my 
opinion, it depends on what content are you creating and its aim: if it is a documentary that wants to show the truth of reality it may be good, but if it is a fiction short movie
for example (that can be a good content for VR and can be immersive as well as a documentary) this kind of things can be useful.

> Confusion Two: Empathy is not something that automatically happens when a user puts on a headset.

> It must be produced as in any other storytelling medium by mature narrative techniques employed by skilled practitioners. The job for the present is to collectively invent those
> techniques.

In my opinion with this assertion Janet Murray has a dig on Chris Milk, when he defines VR a "empathy machine". I too find the Chris Milk's statement (and in general how he 
talkes about VR) overstated. We shoud remember that VR is a medium and need to develops its own techniques in order to succedes, as cinema and TV has done before it.
Janet Murray goes on on this:
> Instead of overhyping the inherent empaty-value of VR documentary, we should look for the specific moments that point to the genuine promise of the medium in creating
> compassionate understanding, and build on those.

Janet Murray then talks about what is needed to invent a new medium:
> To invent a new medium you have to find the fit between the affordances of the co-evolving platform and specific expressive content - the beauty and truth - you want to share
> that could not be as well expressed in other forms.

I think that the keypoint of VR production is finding contents that fit well this medium, and that would not be as effective in any other media.

Janet Murray concludes her article talking about some products she finds inspiring, original and effective. She points out Oscar Raby's and Nonny de la Pena's works, that are 
more political and documentaristic: the former are live-action while the latter are animated. And she also finds interesting Gnomes and Goblins games by Oculus Story Studio.
What this products have in common is a wise interactivity: it is present and it is requested to the user to explore the fictional world, but it is not too invasive.
