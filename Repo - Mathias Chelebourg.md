Mathias Chelebourg is a French director, captivated by innovation and the exploration of immersive technologies.
He discovers VR in 2012 and started his production with advertisments. Then he has experimented a lot with these technologies creating different interesting narrative products.

### Most famous works
Mathias Chelebourg experimented with varius kind of VR immersive narrations.

In 2018 he created with Benoit Felici "The Real Thing": it is a live action documentary about copy of famous european cities placed in China.
>VR is really useful and strong to tell about the relationship between architecture and people.

Mathias Chelebourg learned that it is trick to do a documentary in VR. When they shooted "The Real Thing" the technology was so heavy and it takes a lot of time to set up the gear. But it was really inspiring for him to step into the virtual space by filming it live, so by stepping in it for real.
I loved The Real Thing: for me it was really an amazing experience. VR can be a way to make documentaries more emotional for the user. I also apprecieted the use of camera movements: they guided the user exploration in a natural way, and avoiding motion sickness.

He was thinking about how it was possible to experiment between something like an immersive play and VR and the level of interactivity and engagement that it or an other immersive medium could create. So, in 2017 he co-created with Marie Jourden the experimental product "Alice". In "Alice, the user, wearing a VR headsed, would step inside an actual physical
stage. Around him, some actors would play the script or improvising real time with a motion capture suit on. In this way, the user would interact with animated characters in the virtual world by playing and interacting with them in real time and real place, and he would also be able to interact with props in the virtual world by using them in the physiscal world. In "Alice" they pushed the different aspect of immersing storytelling by adding addresses to the user's different senses.
"Alice" is a single-player play.
>I got very excited about this (Alice's) format. Maybe this is the ultimate VR storytelling. Probabily, VR storytelling is you, the viewer, stepping inside a virtual world, and this virtual world becomes your actual real playground. And you want to be able to interact natively with everything inside of it. You want to organically play with the environment and with the characters. You don't want AI doing this stuff because AI sucks. So, acts is doing a very human interaction. You want a physical stage that you can touch and filled up with people you can interact to.

I have never experienced something like Alice, but it really looks as a profound immersive experience. Because of improvisation, every user lives his own personal experience, that is different from other users': the fact that the experience is custom-made for the single user allows him to feel a stronger sense of immersion. The user really is the main character of the story. As I see it, real time acting and improvisation also allows to integrate more interactions during the experience: there is no risk to destroy the sense of presence or the flux of the story because it would adjust to the user response.

After Alice and the excitement that it produced, Mathias Chelebourg tried this experiment on a larger scale with Jack.
>I wanted this environment to feel like you are stepping into the world of a fairy tale. But you are responsible for everything that's happening to you inside of it. I wanted the viewer to feel totally free to do whatever he likes and to realize that whatever he does the environment and the characters are responding to him.

>It was fully conversational, fully improvisational. And yet you have to maintain some kind of storyline, you have to maintain the storytelling. This is really interesting for a director or a storyteller or even a script editor: this is a really interesting way to writing stories. It is a hybrid between video games, (immersive?) plays, improvisational theatre.
>And when you stop experiment with that sort of format then you learn a lot of things about what is VR and what it means to tell stories with VR.

In my opinion, this format is really powerful in terms of immersive storytelling. The only problem might be that this format doesn't look scalable. I agree with what Mathias Chelebourg says later: having multiple users at the same time was not useful to the experience and could have been restrained the user from playing freely, because they would have felt judged.

I appreciate the fact that Mathias Chelebourg doesn't consider interactions as the only way to create immersion, as he said talking about Alone.
>Interactivity is not the Alpha and Omega of VR. You can go very far with it, but you can also narrate a story in a very traditional linear way and it can still be very interesting and very immersive.

I think that is correct to look at other previous media to create a peculiar language for VR. I really like the fact that mathias Chelebourg does not only look at video games but also at traditional cinema: after all, it has always created strong immersive experiences for the audience.
I am courious about how he switches POV inside Alone, as it's usually done in traditional cinema. I really appreciated when he talked about mirror neurons and how we can empathize more with a situation looking at someone that is living it, insted of having a camera experience thigs in your place.

Mathias Chelebourg's last project is Doctor Who - The Runaway. It is an animated VR interactive episode of the series Doctor Who. 
It was almost the only project he didn't write, because it was written by the actual Doctor Who authors. I was a collaboration between the linear writing of the story and the indroduction of interactivity.

### Thoughts about VR

Talking about writing for VR, Mathias Chelebourg said that usually he wrote what he then produce, but he has cooperate with writers for some project (Doctor Who for example). Most of the writers have never wrote for the VR format, so the writing production become a compromise between a linear traditional storytelling and the introduction of some interactions. Someone would expect video game writers to be more versatile in this area, but in fact they are not: writing video games is different because you have to consider a huge amount of branches and variations.
Mathias Chelebourg explained that he usually have a backbone of linear writing and, on top of that, he have either a couple of pages of improvisations and some notes for interactions.
Talking about storyboarding for VR, he said that he started drawing a cube of views (top, bottom, front, ...). Then, there was people specialized in drowing 360, so they made 360 storyboard. For something like Alice or Jack, Mathias Chelebourg previously created some 3D prototipes of the environment, to learn something about the size of it and the props position. He suggested learning to use Unreal Engine or Unity or game engines in general because they are really useful for prototyping this kind of experience and keeping control on them. Before storyboard there is usually a script: a single one with the interaction pages integrated or different script for linear story and interaction and that. Mathias Chelebourg higlighted that there is not a correct universal way to do scripting for VR, but the important thing is coming up with a solution that is understable for everyone that works on it.
Then, Mathias Chelebourg has been asked some questions about Alone and how he switched the camera POV during the narration. That's because usually we are encouraged to choose a single POV in VR experience and been stuck with it, in order to avoid confusion for the viewers. Instead, he aswered that the switching works very well. He related to traditional cinema and mirror neurons as I wrote before. He also explained that, even when a first person POV works very well and the user is a character in the story, he need to be aware of who he is in the virtual world: seeing himself in the virtual world is helpful for embodiement. Sometimes this is achieved making the user look himself in a mirror that would reflect the image of the avatar. Mathias Chelebourg did that by switching POV to third person in order to make te user look at his character.

Mathias Chelebourg highlited how VR production is not standard yet: how it is writed, directed, shooted is mostly a personal choice that depends on the final goal you want to reach with your final VR product.
At the beginning of his career in VR, around 2012, there were people who started getting knowledge and experience about it. But then they started also making false and wrong assertions about VR: it is impossible to direct a VR piece because you don't have a frame anymore (it is wrong because you still have ha frame in 360 content, it is just that the user is responsible to that framing and the director has to lead the user inside of it), you cannot edit VR because you are inside of it and you are living the experience (it is false because you can use a 360 camera as an actual camera), or even that interactivity is the basis of VR and you don't make VR if there is not interactivity (Mathias Chelebourg explained that he wanted to try really hard proving that this is really wrong. There are a lot of ways to create sense of presence without interactivity. In addition, I would think about traditional cinema and how well it works without interactivity), or that VR must be first person storytelling and the user has to be a character in the story (that is not universally true for every VR work, it depends by his goals).
Mathias Chelebourg provided in my opinion a really nice definition of VR:
>First of all, the impact of VR and immersive storytelling was a real revolution.
>To me, when you add time to photography you have cinema, and then you add space to cinema and you have VR.

And then he went on about media that use space:
>So, I started beeing very excited about medium that uses space. To name some of them: theatre, architecture, theme park. I became really excited about the potential of bringing the learnings from theatre, architecture, theme park into the world of cinema.

In particular, Mathias Chelebourg asserted that maybe the closest medium to VR storytelling is theatre.

About the future development of VR, Mathias Chelebourg thought that is going to be mostly CGI and animated. But he also thought that 360 live action shooting is valid and that it has a lot of potential.
