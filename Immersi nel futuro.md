# Immersi nel Futuro - La Realtà Virtuale, nuova frontiera del cinema e della TV
## Chapter 2 "Introduction to VR" paragraph 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, 17, 18, 19, 21 and Chapter 3.3 "An-Icons"

This is the first italian book about Virtual Reality. Rich in data, interviews and testimonies, the book photographs the national and international panorama, and analyzes future scenarios and opportunities for the public service
and private operators. It is a detailed report that wants to offer, also thanks to the point of view of the protagonists of the creative industry and the production chain, a
critical and updated study on Virtual Reality. 

### Chapter 2 "Introduction to VR"
This chapter starts showing a number of definitions and quotations of various academics about VR.
I was particulary struck by William Gibson's and Jaron Lanier's quotes. 
>Cyberspace. A consensual hallucination experienced daily by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, by children being taught mathematical concepts...
>A graphic representation of data abstracted from banks of every computer in the human system. Unthinkable complexity. Lines of light ranged in the nonspace of the mind,
>clusters and constellations of data. Like city lights, receding...

This quote is from Gibson's book "Neuromancer". I am particulary interested in the fact that he calls cyberspace a "consensual hallucination". I think that it can references to
the suspension of disbelief that media try to achieve. Aristotle first explored the idea of the concept in his "Poetica", in its relation to the principles of theater:
the audience ignores the unreality of fiction in order to experience catharsis. Every media try to achieve suspension of disbelief through different means, but the audience must
collaborate: spectators must want to suspend their critical thinking. That is why the hallucination is consensual.

>When you move like a cat, think like a cat. Body and brain cannot be completely separated. When we weave new bodies into Virtual Reality,
>we are extending the power of our minds as well. This will be the heart of the adventure of Virtual Reality. The deeper meaning of the strange
>avatar that we can use will perhaps consist in awakening the large area of the brain connected to the body.

Jaron Lanier is considered to be the father of Virtual Reality. I like this quote because I find fascinating and peculiar his point of view on VR. VR as a means to awake an area of
our brain makes me think to Sherry Turkle's vision of online spaces as places to discover ourselves and to forge new identities, exposed in "Life on Screen".

Simone Arcagni explains that what makes VR different from other media is the concept of "immersion".
>The keyword is "immersion": changing spectator's status (as the one who is **in front** of the image) into that of a user who is **immersed** in a double (virtual) of
>reality that therefore he lives.

In this case, we are reflecting on "immersion" as his physical meaning: the user is inside the images that VR (or 360° movies) produce. The images are all around him.
The book then make a list of different types of digital immersion: VR 360, VR Real-Time, AR, Videomapping, MR, XR. These technologies are for sure immersive. But, in my opinion,
immersion seen by an emotional point of view can be achived also with traditional cinema, when the spectator is totally engaged in the film.

Technologies used to create VR experiences are, for now, mainly visual and audio: CGI and 3D modeling is used to recreate a virual environment for the user to explore, but 360
cameras are also used for live action clip; the most immersive audio technique is Ambisonics for the creation of a 3D audio.

VR is a new medium, but it has been developed since the 80s. Anyway, VR is not mainstream yet. This happens because there are no standards either in productions or, mostly,
in storytelling. Media as cinema has developed their narrative rules during the years, that are shared by every professional. While every VR artists try to develop their own
narrative rules, in order to achive their personal goal through their product.
Anyway, Simone Arcagni tries to identify VR storytelling's main features. 
>If we can try to define the most intrinsically necessary characteristics of the VR experience we can list immersion, interactivity (on different degrees) and the
>strong sensory presence.

### Chapter 3.3 "An-Icons"
Different reserarches are analyzed in this chapter. I am focusing on “AN-ICON. An-iconology: History, Theory, and Practices of Environmental Images” (2019-2024), a project by
Philosophy Department at University of Milan.
As is explained in the book, the project proposes “an-iconology” as a new paradigm that allows to face the theoretical challenges posed by the VR, the AR, and by other new media
that differ from traditional images. These new media question their own status as "images-of", that is to say, "icons", to be transformed into images that deny themselves,
therefore into "an-icons".

"An-icons" reach this goal through three fundamental trends:
- Im-mediation: images reach the user in an immediate way through a massive use of technologies; but technology mediation is hidden. This is quite a paradox that makes me think
about the film "Matrix": it critics digital technology by using it massively.
- Frame absence: in contrast to traditional cinema, that presents his images confined in a rectangular frame, VR and 360 video images are all around the user.
- Sense of presence: is the main concept of immersive images. The user is technically "inside" the image. Above all, the sense of presence that you want to create is to make
the user believe to be immersed in the reality he sees: environmental images aim to achive a sense of presence overcoming the principle of referentiality (the image is no more
representation of something), which establishes a link but also a distance between a traditional image and what it represents. In traditional film there is a distance between
the audience and what is represented (we are more aware of the fact that it is only a representation), while since the immersive image is around us the distance with the
representation is attenuated and occurs the presence effect.

In the “AN-ICON” project, the features of this unprecedented experience are described through eight keywords:
- Transparency: in VR we don't see the physical medium anymore. However, this is a paradox since there are a lot of technological and theoretical limits to overcome.
- Illusion: cinema is the most illusory technology. Lev Manovich in "The Language of New Media" (chapter 4) explains the difference between illusion of reality and realism:
cinema goal is to create realism to make the spectator immersed in the story narrated. Environmental images want to create illusion of reality removing the distance between
the represented object and the representation.
- Simulation: a copy of reality is created.
- Hyper-realism: simple photographic realism is overcome by very high definition images: CG images are so full of details that they are more real than reality. It is a new
aesthetic front offered by technological innovation. It is a path that can be taken but not is required. It is one of the possible expressive possibilities of the “an-icons”
(environmental images), alongside of options that instead go in the direction of an accentuated stylization or abstraction.
- Immersivity: the user is inside environmental images. I am interested in the link between immersivity and sense of presence.
- Interaction: "an-icons" users are not passive. They are often required to interact with digital images. But storytellers have to be careful in introducing interaction in their
narration: a massive interaction can destroy both the meaning of the story and sense of presence. 
- Embodiement / Avatar: interaction with environmental images tends to involve the whole body of the users. Processing
of the stimuli of the “ani-iconic” world that the body receives occurs through a process of embodiment. Sometimes users are represented inside the virtual environment through
an avatar.
- Multy-sensory: the bodily nature of involvement with environmental images implies multi-sensoriality. The "an-icons" aim to reach the totality of the perceptive channels of
users. Embodiment is reached stimulating different senses.
