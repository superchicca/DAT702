Mathias Chelebourg is a French director, captivated by innovation and the exploration of immersive technologies.
He discovers VR in 2012 and started his production with advertisments. Then he has experimented a lot with these technologies creating different interesting narrative products.

### Most famous works
Mathias Chelebourg experimented with varius kind of VR immersive narrations.

In 2018 he created with Benoit Felici "The Real Thing": it is a live action documentary about copy of famous european cities placed in China.
>VR is really useful and strong to tell about the relationship between architecture and people.

Mathias Chelebourg learned that it is trick to do a documentary in VR. When they shooted "The Real Thing" the technology was so heavy and it takes a lot of time to set up the gear. But it was really inspiring for him to step into the virtual space by filming it live, so by stepping in it for real.

He was thinking about how it was possible to experiment between something like an immersive play and VR and the level of interactivity and engagement that it or an other immersive medium could create. So, in 2017 he co-created with Marie Jourden the experimental product "Alice". In "Alice, the user, wearing a VR headsed, would step inside an actual physical
stage. Around him, some actors would play the script or improvising real time with a motion capture suit on. In this way, the user would interact with animated characters in the virtual world by playing and interacting with them in real time and real place, and he would also be able to interact with props in the virtual world by using them in the physiscal world. In "Alice" they pushed the different aspect of immersing storytelling by adding addresses to the user's different senses.
"Alice" is a single-player play.
