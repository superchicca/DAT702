**Synopsis**
From "Clouds over Sidra" official site:
> Meet Sidra. This charming 12-year-old girl will guide you through her temporary home: The Zaatari Refugee Camp in Jordan. Zaatari is home to 130,000 Syrians fleeing violence
> and war, and children make up half the camp's population. In this lyrical VR film, Sidra leads you through her daily life: Eating, sleeping, learning and playing in the vast
> desert city of tents.

**Technical and Stylistic Analysis**
I think that it is still an IE, but it is less immersive that INVASION!. It is more difficult for the user to really feel inside the refugee camp. But when children look at
him and validate his presence I think that immersion is reached.
I think the highest level of immersion are reached when the kids are aware of the user presence.
