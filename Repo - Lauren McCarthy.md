>We are been told to choose between the left and right brain, between study art and engineering, between creative and analytical thinking.
>Our society tell us that art and business are not connected, but what if society is wrong? What if it's misleading us?
>The good news is that understanding what art is can bring us to a new revelation.
>Art does matter in innovation technology and entrepeneurship.
>(...) Art is not an object, art is a mindset.

I have been particularly touched by this statement because I can totally realte to it: I study Cinema and Media Engineering, a university course that is based on the union between
scientific and humanistic subjects. I think that my studies make me able to find a point of contact between art and technology: learning how digital technology works and math
processes behind it I am able to better understand art and to make the best choices in art production.

In this episode, we speak to the artist and computer programmer Lauren Lee McCarthy. In her work, she creates artworks that use a variety of media and techniques, including
performance, artificial intelligence, and programmed computer-based interaction.

*How do you find connection in this virtual world? What does it take to feel connection?*
> I think part of it is being intentional about the time that you spend and the kind of energy and throughput that you are putting out there, feeling like you can just set some
> boundaries for your life. I think right now it feels really hard to do: people know were you are at every moment. (The point is) figuring out how to work these technologies in a
> way that works for us.
> Then, I think that connection involves tapping into some sense of vulnerability and offer some of yourself to another person. That sounds great but is not necessarily our normal
> mode of interaction: we are much more defensive. Rightly so sometimes. But I always wondering how do we open up these moments?

About online dating, but I think it can be applied also to digital media, Lauren McCarthy says:
> How do we maintain this feeling of each individual person and their importance and their presence and not seeing them as just one more user?

Intimacy and technology:
> One reason I'm so fascinated by intimacy in my work is because I feel like I'm someone that has a difficult time socially, especially when I'm first meeting people.
> (...) So, a lot of my projects feel like these attempts to hack this situation.
