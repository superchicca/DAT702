For Chris Milk, the key point of his productions is to put the user inside it: the user has to be the main character of the story.

>It's difficult to explain (VR) because it's a very **experiential** medium. You feel your way inside of it. It's a machine, but inside of it it feels like real life, it feels like truth. And **you feel present** in the world that you are inside and you feel present with the people that you are inside of it with. 

Chris Milk highlithes how VR is able to create a strong sense of presence: as I see it, that is the most important aspect of immersion. And surely VR is advantaged in doing that:
by putting the user inside the 360 image, the emotional sense of present is strengthen by the physical sense of presence (even if it is virtual).

Then, he shows to the audience some images from his short 360 movie "Clouds over Sidra". The movie is about Sidra, a refugee young girl from Syria: it follows the twelve year old in her every day life the Za’atari camp in Jordan – home to 84,000 Syrian refugees. The film was commissioned as part of the UN’s advocacy at the World Economic Forum in Davos to state and business leaders and offers a unique perspective into the lives of the world’s most vulnerable people. 
At the beginning, the user is in front of Sidra and she talk to him: in my opinion, this is the moment in which the user can empathize the most with Sidra, because there is a little interaction that strenghten the sense of presence. When the refugees are aware of the user's precence (the boys that are playing videogames turn and smile at the camera, the kids come all around the camera greeting the user), the sense of presence is maximum.

>(VR) It's not a videogame peripheral. It connects humans to other humans in a profound way that I've never seen before in any other form of media. And it can change people perception of each other. And that's how I think Virtual Reality has the potential to actually change the world.
>So, it's a machine. But through this machine we become more compassionate, we become more empathetic, and we become more connected. And ultimately, we become more human.

I think as Chris Milk that VR is an empathy machine: it can use the audience's feelings to create a strong sense of presence and immersion. But I think that it can be disruptive saying that VR can change the world and can make us more human: I think that it has the same potential of other digital media, but it needs a different language to tell stories. 
The short movie about war and refugees made me think about Brian de Palma's film "Redacted": it tells a horrible war story about Iraq simulating different media (a documentary from a soldier / film school's student, US and extremists websites and TV news, videocalls, security cameras, ...). For me, it was really painful whatching this movie, and I think because everything felt so true and so close to me. But I loved how the film was shooted and edited: I think that simulating different media the story gained realism and created a more immersive experience for the audience. In my opinion, even if it was a film and the other media were simulated, this shows how other media can create a strong sense of presence and an immersive experience for the audience as VR, but with different languages. 
In addition, even though VR is surely a powerful medium to create immersion, we have to be aware that maybe it is more difficult to achieve than, for example, in a film: that is because interactions can destroy the flux of the story and so the sense of presence.
In conclusion, I agree with Chris Milk we he defines VR as an empathy machine, but I think that Céline Tricart is right when she says that "VR is an empathy machine, as a boo or a film can be". It is a powerful medium, but still a medium.
